about round robin Round Robin is a CPU scheduling algorithm where each process is assigned a fixed time slot in a cyclic way. 
It is simple, easy to implement, and starvation-free as all processes get fair share of CPU. 
It is preemptive as processes are assigned CPU only for a fixed slice of time at most. 
The disadvantage of it is more overhead of context switching. 
completion Time: Time at which process completes its execution. 
Turn Around Time: Time Difference between completion time and arrival time. Turn Around Time = Completion Time – Arrival Time Waiting Time(W.T): Time Difference between turn around time and burst time. Waiting Time = Turn Around Time – Burst Time. 
example : using round-robin algorithm having same arrival time with time quantum 1 unit and to find average waiting and turn around time.
Processes Arrival time Burst time 
1          0              3 
2          0              4 
3          0              3

output:- Processes  Burst time  Waiting time  Turn around time
            1        10             13         23
            2        5              10         15
            3        8              13         21
Average waiting time = 12
Average turn around time = 19.6667
